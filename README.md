# Quandoo Automation

** Steps to run the test cases**
- Install Pycharm(for better experience)
- Clone the project using git clone command
- Install selenium using "Pip install selenium"(Hoping you have python and pip installed in the system if not refer to this sites: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/ and https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install pytest using "pip install pytest"
- Install requests using "pip install requests"(this is to run the API test cases)
- I have already committed the chrome and geckdrivers in the pack itself need not to download(path may be refereing to the absolute sometimes, please make not of this)
- When all set then all the test cases an be run individually or whole as directory.
- For individual test of the cases, there is a run button which directly runs the code 
- To run the whole directory run the following command in terminal "pytest --verbose --capture=no"
